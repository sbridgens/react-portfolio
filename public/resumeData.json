His knowledge and committment to getting the software working for the areas under his control was of a high standard. His Army training and direct and concentrated approach meant issues were resolved quickly and efficiently. I liked working with Simon, he is easy to get on with and puts anyone who come into contact with him at their ease, plus his humour was ever evident and this made the project a much happier group to be with especially away from base. I have no hesitation in recommending Simon since he will be a very good asset to any project. He is articulate and speaks with authority on software and hardware systems and has good customer facing skills. I really do hope I can work again with him in the near future.",

I have worked with Simon both in the factory and on Customer site and when the pressure is really on Simon has a fantastic ability to remain calm and focussed which gives a high level of confidence to the customer. He has a great ability to analyse the most technical of issues and either resolve them himself or provide highly detailed reports back to R&D which in turn provides a fast turn around for the customer. Simon is extremely professional and knowledgeable which is why he is highly recommended by me",
